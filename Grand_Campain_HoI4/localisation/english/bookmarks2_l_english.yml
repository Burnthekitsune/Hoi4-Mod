 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. Although the gameplay went smooth until now, this is no more Victoria II. The ideological struggle will reap millions of men worldwide. A delicate equilibrium managed to avoid the beast being unleashed but, as the world starts to get doused on gasoline, only God knows how long will that yield, as the single spark may determine a collapse of society as pops in Victoria II knew."

 neutrality_GP_CONV_DESC:0 "What makes a country turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? A glitch of the converter? Or was it just born with a heart full of neutrality?"
 democratic_GP_CONV_DESC:0 "The Parliamentarian institutions of this country will hold strong while brave men, willingly sacrificing their lives, will fight against the oppressive regimes that threaten their families and the land of their forefathers."
 communism_GP_CONV_DESC:0 "Born after the Red Revolution, the Bolshevik regime managed to reorganize the country in a strong military and industrial power. But the old liberal ghost haunts us. Will the Red Army be enough to send it to the Underworld?"
 fascism_GP_CONV_DESC:0 "What's worse than a Liberal politician? A Liberal country. That's why the Brownshirts, tired of hearing dead and cold debates in 'Parliaments' decided to seize the power. Our Führer promised us that he will finally reconquer what the Liberal state failed to."

 X10_hist: "The Ahshamali Union, after becoming the 1st communist nation in the 19th century, has gone though many ups and downs. The former empire has been released, fitting in with ideological goals, however it no longer is the world leader it once was. Tensions have cooled with the JSAL for now, but these cooled tensions will not last. It is time to unite the communists of the world once more and defend the workers!"
 OTHER_GRAND_CAMPAIGN_DESC: "Other Countries have their own unique history in this world as well."
 ENG_hist: "Britania was a latecomer to the revolution, having 3 before the 3rd one overthrew the government. As a consequence of the 1st one, thee lost most of Ireland and Iceland. Though for now they are closely tied to the Ahsamali Union, their allegiance sometimes alligns more with the JSAL."
 V23_hist: "Romgana, once the ruler of the Italian peninsula. Now reduced to a shadow of its former self. Though it has a plan to play the larger powers off eachother and maintain neutrality while also gaining land."
 GER_hist: "A rising star of the early 19th century, the later parts of the century has seen decline due to the rise of the Uhorskpolanian Union and invasions from the JSAL and Muraa. Now there is a large amount of land they wish to take back."
 SCA_hist: "Once one of the strongest countries in Europe, it has seen a decline, as well as revolts in the east. Caught between wildly different ideologies, it is unclear which route it will go down."
 Z03_hist: "A former colony of the Ahshamli Union, now independent due to the aid of the JSAL after a massive civil war. The lack of a large industrial base, the millions of deaths due to war, and the still lingering tension have lead to the country being unstable for now."
 BRA_hist: "A large nation but barely industralized at all. Almost none of their natrual resources are exploited, which will good for the enviroment, means that it will be a lot of effort before they are ready for any sort of war. Their geographical isolation does, however, mean they are failry safe from most conflict."
 X42_hist: "A large, neutral contry with greater ambitions. They have border disputes with all but 1 of their neighbors, and recently 3 of them have banded together in a mutual defensive pact."
